Your company website is your most important digital asset. It's your virtual store, your portfolio, and your number one salesperson. But what happens if this salesperson is slow, neglected, and difficult to communicate with? The answer is simple: potential customers turn around and go to the competition.

Many business owners don't even know that their website is actively losing money instead of making it. The following 7 "deadly sins" will help you recognize if your site is a barrier to your growth, not the engine of it.

### 1. The Trial of Patience: Slow Loading

In 2025, users want everything immediately. If a page takes longer than 3 seconds to load, more than half of visitors close it immediately. Slowness not only destroys the user experience, but Google also punishes it and ranks it lower in search results.
**The question you must ask:** *"Does my site load instantly, or does it force my most valuable visitors to wait?"*

### 2. The Pocket Test: Unusable on Mobile

More than 60% of web traffic comes from mobile. If your site is hard to read on mobile, buttons are too small, and the menu is unmanageable, you'll lose most of your visitors instantly. "Responsive design" is no longer an extra today; it's a basic requirement.
**The question you must ask:** *"Have I already tried clicking through a purchase or contact process on my own phone?"*

### 3. The Sin of Outdated Design

Your website's design is the first impression. A site with a look from 10 years ago suggests that your company is not up to date either. Trust is built or collapsed in seconds. Modern, clean design communicates professionalism and reliability.
**The question you must ask:** *"If I saw my site for the first time today, would I trust this company?"*

### 4. The Labyrinth Effect: Complicated Navigation

If visitors have to search for the most important information (e.g., prices, contact, services), they quickly become frustrated and leave. A good website is logically built and clearly guides the user towards their goal.
**The question you must ask:** *"Can a completely new visitor reach the contact form in 3 clicks?"*

### 5. The Case of the Invisible Man: Weak SEO

You can have the most beautiful website in the world if no one finds it. A lack of search engine optimization (SEO) means that when someone searches for your service, Google will show your competition.
**The question you must ask:** *"If I search for my most important service on Google, does my company appear on the first page?"*

### 6. The Missing Call to Action (CTA)

Your website must clearly tell the visitor what to do next on every page. "Request a Quote", "Contact Us", "Download the Guide". If there are no clear Call to Action buttons, visitors get lost and navigate away.
**The question you must ask:** *"Is there a clear, logical next step for the visitor at the end of every subpage?"*

### +1. The Security Nightmare

A "Not Secure" notice in the browser, an outdated system that is vulnerable to attacks – these all undermine your credibility. Secure operation (SSL certificate, modern technology) is a basic trust factor.
**The question you must ask:** *"Am I completely at ease regarding the security of my site?"*

If your answer to any of the above questions is uncertain, it's likely time for a thorough review.
