"How much does a website cost?" – this is the question asked at the beginning of every digital project. The short answer no one likes to hear: "It depends." The long but much more useful answer helps you understand that a website's price is not just a simple product price tag, but a reflection of the value of a complex, personalized service.

In this article, we won't just show approximate prices; we'll help you understand what's behind these numbers. We break down the process so you can see exactly why it's worth choosing a professional solution and how to think about your website as one of your business's most important, revenue-generating investments.

### The Components of Costs: Why it matters who and how does it?

An effective website is much more than a beautiful design. Behind the scenes, serious strategic and technical work takes place, which directly affects the result and the price.

#### 1. Strategy and Planning (The Blueprint)
This is the most critical, yet most frequently skipped step in cheaper solutions. Before we code a single line, we must understand your business.
* **Goals:** What is the website's primary task? Lead generation, sales, information, branding?
* **Target Audience:** Who are we talking to? What problem of theirs are we providing a solution for?
* **User Journeys (UX):** How do we lead the visitor from the very first click to contact or purchase?
Without a careful planning phase, the most beautiful website remains just an expensive online brochure.

#### 2. Custom Design (The First Impression)
A downloadable WordPress template can be tempting due to its low price, but it has many disadvantages: your company won't be unique, its code is often unnecessarily complex (slowing down the site), and customization options are limited. In contrast, a custom UI/UX design:
* **Reflects your brand:** Colors, fonts, imagery all represent your company.
* **Speaks to your target audience:** The design is built on user research to be as user-friendly as possible.
* **Optimized for conversion:** Every element (buttons, forms) has a reason and a purpose: to turn the visitor into a customer.

#### 3. Development and Technology (The Engine)
The technological background determines the website's speed, security, and future-proofness. In our case, using the Astro framework guarantees market-leading loading speed, which is essential for good Google rankings and user experience. A site built on clean, modern code is cheaper and simpler to maintain in the long run than an outdated system riddled with plugins.

#### 4. Functionality (The Extras)
The price depends significantly on the required functions. A 5-page introductory site requires less work than a:
* **Professional blog engine**
* **Content Management System (CMS)** so you can also edit content
* **Webshop** with a secure payment system
* **Multilingualism**
* **Custom calculators** or forms

### Approximate Price Ranges in the EU Market (2025)

Based on the above, it can already be seen why there is a wide range in prices. The following categories help place projects:

* **Basic Business Website (`Starter Package`):** approx. €500 - €1,200. A 3-5 page, custom-designed, responsive site that is a perfect foundation for a small business.
* **Advanced Business Website (`Growth Package`):** approx. €1,200 - €3,000. This is where unique functions appear, such as a blog, CMS, and more advanced SEO settings.
* **Webshop or Custom Web Application (`Premium/Custom`):** from approx. €3,000. Complex e-commerce functions, developments covering unique business logic.

### Summary: Think in Investment, Not Cost

Our most important advice: don't look at your website as a mandatory cost to be paid. Think of it as your best salesperson who works day and night, never sleeps, and is capable of bringing in customers from anywhere in the world. A cheap, poorly functioning website actually costs much more: in wasted opportunities, deterred customers, and bad reputation. A professional, well-designed, and built website is one of the best investments you can make for your company's growth.
