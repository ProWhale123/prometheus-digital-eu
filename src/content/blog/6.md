"How much does a website cost?" – this is one of the most common questions a digital agency receives. And the answer is almost always the same: "It depends." However, this isn't very helpful for a business owner planning their budget.

In this article, we reveal the truth behind website pricing. We won't just give you numbers; we'll help you understand what's behind the price tags and how to think about your website as an investment that can be one of your business's most important engines.

### Why is it not like buying a car?

Determining the price of a website is not like buying a car, where there are fixed models and lists of extras. A professional website is a custom, tailored solution to a business problem. Its price is determined by the following main factors:

1.  **Strategy and Planning (The Blueprint):** A cheap website starts with "what colors do you like?". A professional project starts here: "who are your customers and how are we going to create more value for them?". Research, target audience analysis, designing user journeys, and developing a conversion strategy take time, but this is the foundation for everything that brings in revenue later.

2.  **Custom Design (The First Impression):** A downloadable template is cheap, but rarely unique and often full of unnecessary code that slows down the site. A custom UI/UX design ensures that your website is not only beautiful but reflects your brand and logically guides the user towards a purchase or contact.

3.  **Development and Technology (The Engine):** This is where a website's speed, security, and future-proofness are decided. A modern, Astro-based development that is fast and SEO-friendly costs more than "clicking together" an outdated template. However, this investment pays off in better Google rankings and lower maintenance costs.

4.  **Functionality (The Extras):** A simple, 5-page introductory site obviously costs less than a complex webshop with a secure payment system, a custom calculator, or a blog engine and newsletter system. The more custom functions needed, the more development time it requires.

### Categories and Approximate Price Ranges

To give you a guide nonetheless, here are the categories based on market prices in 2025:

* **Basic Business Website (approx. €500 - €1,200):** A 3-5 page, custom-designed, responsive introductory site that is a perfect foundation for a small business. Focus on presenting the company and contact.

* **Advanced Business Website (approx. €1,200 - €2,400):** This already includes custom functions, such as a professional blog engine, content management system (CMS) so the company can edit content itself, and advanced SEO settings.

* **Webshop or Custom Web Application (approx. from €2,400 to the sky):** This includes e-commerce functions, payment integrations, user accounts, and developments covering unique business logic.

### Think of it as an investment, not a cost

Our most important advice: don't look at your website as a mandatory cost to be paid. Think of it as your best salesperson who works day and night, never sleeps, and is capable of bringing in customers from anywhere in the world.

A cheap, poorly functioning website actually costs much more: in wasted opportunities, deterred customers, and bad reputation. A professional, well-designed, and built website is one of the best investments you can make for your company's growth.
